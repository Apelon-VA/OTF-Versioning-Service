OTF-Versioning-Service
======================

Repository for the versioning module

JavaFX
------

If you do not have access to a repository with the jfxrt libraries, then you
will need to copy them to your local repository before building the project.
This can be done with the following command:

```
mvn org.codeartisans.javafx:javafx-deployer-maven-plugin:1.2:install
```
